# Jared Bracci WordPress Theme
## Built on the incredible [Mozaik starter theme](https://github.com/MozaikAgency/wp-theme-starter)

This is the WordPress theme for the Jared Bracci website.

## Development Guidelines

- Avoid committing the built theme to the project repository
- Avoid committing the `wp-uploads` directory to the project repository
- Avoid making changes directly to the built theme -- Always use the build process
- In production avoid uploading the theme development directory to a public server
- It is good practice to enable `WP_DEBUG` in your `wp-config.php` file, *but only* during development

## Theme Development Process

### Setup

1. Install WordPress and clear it of unnecessary default themes & plugins
1. Clone/Download the contents of this repository into a directory in your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory (eg: "my-theme_dev") _this will be your "dev theme"_
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the dev theme, *eg:* `cd wp-content/themes/<my-theme>_dev`
1. (**Note:** The next steps **require** nodejs *@5.0.0* and gulpjs *@^3.9.0*)
1. Run `npm install` to install all dev dependencies
1. Change the `project.config.js` file with your new theme's configuration
1. Run `gulp build` to generate the "built theme" for the first time
1. Log in to the admin and enable the *built theme*
	 (**Note:** The *dev theme* is not a valid theme, that's fine! Don't delete it or try to enable it!)
1. Start Developing!

### Development

1. Run `gulp` to begin the dev build process that uses libsass, browser-sync and webpack
1. Develop your theme in the `/assets` and `/theme` directories, *the "built theme" will be generated by gulp*
1. Optional stuff:
	- use `npm install --save <module(s)>` or `bower install --save <module(s)>` to easily manage js dependencies, then use `var <module> = require('<module>');`
	  or `import <module> from '<module>';` anywhere in your js files you want to use them
	- explore the [`/library` directory](https://github.com/MozaikAgency/wp-theme-starter/tree/master/theme/library) in the dev theme for anything useful to your project.

### Production

1. Delete files you are not using from inside the `/theme` directory
1. [Add a screenshot.png](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Screenshot)
1. Before deploying run `gulp build` to generate a production ready version of the built theme
1. Deploy the built theme directory, *not the dev directory*
